## Introduction

Neutrino is a service that allows developers to link their mobile and web applications with a real time cloud data storage. 
Every time you create a new application, you need to write code to authenticate users, store data, manage infrastructure, handle scalability.
Neutrino gives you out-of-the-box solution to easily manage your applicationâ€™s users and data. You can be sure that your data will always be available and scale along with your application.
